What is Shiva?
--------------

The Mozilla Hacks blog kindly published a nice article that explains the ideas
that inspire this software:
`Shiva: More than a RESTful API to your music collection
<https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/03/shiva-more-than-a-restful-api-to-your-music-collection/>`_.


Why Shiva?
----------

Shiva is the name of the `crater <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva_crater>`_
that would have been created by the
`K-Pg event <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event>`_
that extincted the `dinosaurs <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlAeN3Qxlvc>`_.
