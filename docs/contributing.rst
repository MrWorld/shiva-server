Sending code
------------

If you want to implement a new feature or fix a bug, remember that every PR
that you issue must:

* Strictly follow the `PEP8 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_.
* Include documentation, if applicable.

  + Detailed documentation of the new feature.
  + Update old documentation for functionality changes.

* Include tests.
* Not break previous tests.

The `CI tool <https://travis-ci.org/tooxie/shiva-server>`_ will check for most
of this, so make sure the build passes.


Reporting bugs
--------------

Please report bugs, recommend enhancements or ask questions in our
`issue tracker <https://github.com/tooxie/shiva-server/issues>`_. Before
reporting bugs please make sure of the following:

* The bug was not previously reported.
* You have the latest version installed.
* The bug is not actually a feature.
