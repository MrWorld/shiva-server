Shiva client
============

The `Shiva-Client <https://github.com/tooxie/shiva-client>`_ is a web-based
front-end for Shiva-Server built as a single page application using HTML5
technologies. It includes its own test web server so you don't need to install
one.


Wish you were here
------------------

Or you can also build your own client and put your own ideas into practice. I
encourage you to do so. Build your own music player that meets your exact
needs.

Feel free to `issue a PR <https://github.com/tooxie/shiva-server/pulls>`_ if
you need new functionality in Shiva.
